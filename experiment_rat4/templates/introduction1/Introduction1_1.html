    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> <b>Please read the following directions carefully:</b></p>
    <p>In a moment you’ll have the opportunity to move around a grid representing the forest, like this:
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="image-and-circle" display:inline>
        <a href="Grid"> <img class="game-image" style= "width:300px" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='graphics/Grid.png') }}" /> </a>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Any time you move on to a square with an item, you will put it into your basket, and it will be used in making the traditional dish. If you don’t move on to a square with an item, it won’t be used in making the dish. If you step on the pot or the fermentation case all items currently in your basket will be impacted by that specific process. You may use the pot and/or fermentation case on your items at any time. Items you collect after you’ve stepped on the pot or fermentation case will not be impacted by them unless you step on the pot or fermentation case once again after collecting those items.
    </p>
    <p>When you are finished, step on the bowl to deliver the traditional dish.</p>
