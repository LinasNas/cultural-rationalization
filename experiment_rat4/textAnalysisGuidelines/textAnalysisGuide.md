**Primary Text Response**

"We’re curious about your thinking process. Please tell us what you were
thinking as you watched other people collect the plants for the
traditional dish and what you were thinking as you collected them."

I.  **Did the participant indicate thoughts about the item(s) and/or
    process(es), and did they draw on prior personal experiences
    regarding their thoughts on item(s) and/or process(es)? Yes (1), No
    (0)**

    A.  A response merits a “1” if the participant makes or implies
        distinctions between items, processes, or item-process pairings
        that are grounded in prior knowledge, rather than social
        learning. The item need not be named explicitly (e.g., “I chose
        based on color”; “I fermented the ones that would benefit from
        it”; “I tried to make a lasagna”). In theory, these distinctions
        could lead to all items being chosen (e.g., “I went for salty,
        sweet, bitter, and spicy”).

    B.  A response merits a “0” if it includes no distinction between
        items (e.g., “I wanted to collect them all”; “I went for
        variety”).

    C.  A response also merits a “0” if the participant merely states a
        policy without implying it is based on item-level or
        process-level distinctions (e.g., “I always go for ginger”; “I
        decided to ferment them all”). However, elaborated responses
        such as “I always go for ginger because it is
        best/healthy/spicy” or “I fermented them all because that’s
        best/you need to/it softens them” do merit a “1”.

    D.  If a participant makes such distinctions as outlined in
        guideline A merely in service of understanding others, the
        response merits a “0”.

    E.  If the participant distinguishes between items/processes merely
        to be different from others, the response merits a “0”.

    F.  Distinctions attributed solely to accidental actions (e.g., “I
        stepped on the wrong thing”) merit a “0”.

II.  **Did the participant reference learning from or copying others’
    actions in any form? Yes (1), No (0)**

    A.  A response merits a “1” if the participant states or implies
        that observing others influenced their own behavior (e.g., “I
        copied the others”; “I did it by watching them”; “Because I saw
        what they did”). However, merely noting others' actions and
        stating one's own behavior without any implied link does not
        merit a “1” (e.g., “I saw they mostly liked ginger. When it was
        my turn, I decided fermenting was good”).

    B.  Expressing mere curiosity or interest in others’ actions without
        implying copying does not merit a “1”.

    C.  If a participant meets other criteria for a “1” but indicates a
        wholesale denial to copy others, they should receive a “0”
        (e.g., “I saw them collect ginger and thought about doing the
        same thing, but decided I wanted to be different”).

    D.  If a participant meets other criteria for a “1” but says
        something indicating their denial to follow specific actions of
        others’ while implying some conformity, the response merits a
        “1” (e.g., “I thought about doing my own thing but in the end
        followed some of the steps everyone else did”).

    E.  Framing shared actions as a coincidence or common choice, in the
        absence of any statement or implication of copying, merits a “1”
        (e.g., “I guess we all really liked ginger!”).

    F.  References to remembering or memorizing others’ behavior merit a
        “1”, as we take this to imply an intent to copy unless stated
        otherwise.

III.  **Did the participant reference learned information from others
    about the item(s) and/or process(es) that would generalize beyond
    the making of the dish?**

    A.  A response merits a “1” only if it meets the guidelines detailed
        in this item and received a rating of “1” on item II of the
        “Primary Text Response” section.

    B.  The learned information can be evaluative (e.g., “Everyone went
        for ginger… I guess ginger is really good”) or substantive
        (e.g., “I guess ginger is healthy”) to merit a “1”.

    C.  A response does not merit a “1” if the learned information
        pertains only to the specific task (e.g., “...I guess ginger is
        important for this dish”; “...I guess it must be traditional”).

    D.  Procedural knowledge without evaluative or substantive content
        (e.g., “I learned: boil ginger”) does not merit a “1”.

    E.  If a participant provides a substantive rationalization but does
        not imply that the information was learned through observing
        others, the response should be coded as a “0”.

IV.  **Did the participant reference learned information matching the
    “correct” values of the item(s) and/or process(es) that would
    generalize beyond the making of the dish?**

    A.  The learned information can be evaluative (e.g., “Everyone went
        for ginger… I guess ginger is really good”) or substantive
        (e.g., “I guess ginger is healthy”) to merit a “1”.

    B.  A response does not merit a “1” if the learned information
        pertains only to the specific task (e.g., “...I guess ginger is
        important for this dish”; “...I guess it must be traditional”).

    C.  Procedural knowledge without evaluative or substantive content
        (e.g., “I learned: boil ginger”) does not merit a “1”.

    D.  The rationalization merits a “1” only if it aligns with the true
        underlying valence of the item or process.

**Secondary Text Response**

“Do you think that any of the specific ingredients are important to add?
Why? Are there ones that it is important to avoid? Why? Do you think the
processes of boiling and/or fermenting are important too? Why?"
